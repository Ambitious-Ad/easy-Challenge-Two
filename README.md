# Easy Challenge Two â€“ Life-Use Calculator

Preform mathematical calculations 

I am building this as a C++ console application using visual studio
The learning focus is on 
- Writing clean, modular code
- Making the calculator user-friendly
- Practicing core concepts (like functions, conditionals, and input handling)
- learning more about git and GitHub

I built this as part of the challenge from r/dailyprogrammer
